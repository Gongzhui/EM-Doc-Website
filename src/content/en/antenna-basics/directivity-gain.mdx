# Directivity, Gain, and Realized Gain

## Directivity

> Directivity $D$ is defined as the ratio of the power density at a far-field point in the direction of maximum radiation to the power density at the same point for an isotropic antenna with the same radiated power.
> -- Antenna Theory and Techniques (2nd ed.), Zhong Shunshi

The reference for directivity is **the same radiated power**. In other words, losses and mismatch are not considered.

## Gain

> Antenna gain is defined as the ratio of the power density at a far-field point in the direction of maximum radiation to the power density at the same point for an isotropic antenna with the same input power.
> -- Antenna Theory and Techniques (2nd ed.), Zhong Shunshi

The reference for gain is **the same input power**. That means losses are considered, but mismatch is not. The relationship between gain and directivity is:

$$
G=\eta D
$$

where $\eta$ is the antenna efficiency.

## Realized Gain

In HFSS, realized gain includes impedance mismatch compared to gain.
